  "summary": "The diff modifies 5 key frontend components (ImageGenerator, PhotoGallery, VideoGallery, VideoGenerator, SearchPage) plus supporting files. All five REQs are substantially addressed: multi-platform fallback image sources, YouTube-free MP4 video sources, inline <video> elements, and fallback chains. However, some acceptance criteria have gaps, particularly around using truly distinct platforms (Unsplash vs Picsum) for REQ-27 and REQ-31, and around chat message rendering for REQ-29 and REQ-30.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-27",
      "requirement": "Image sources are drawn from at least two different public platforms (e.g., Unsplash and Picsum/Pexels)",
      "reason": "The ImageGenerator buildImageUrls function uses only Picsum Photos for all three fallback URLs (seed variant 1, seed variant 2, and random). No second platform such as Unsplash or Pexels is used.",

      "requirement": "Photos shared in chat messages also render without broken icons",
