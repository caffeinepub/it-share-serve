  "summary": "ShareServe is an instant messaging app with photo and video sharing, AI image and video generation, account creation with custom username/profile number, contacts system, dark theme UI, text effects, and visual polish. Messaging is between in-app accounts only. AI generation follows standard content policies. Authentication uses Apple or Google login instead of Internet Identity.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Messaging is in-app only; no external SMS or phone network integration",
    "AI generation features must follow standard content policies — no unregulated generation",
    "Authentication uses Apple or Google OAuth — Internet Identity is not used",
    "Web photo/video search results are private — not displayed on user profile, feed, or any shared area",
    "Do not use YouTube as a video source — use alternative platforms (e.g., Pexels, Mixkit, Coverr) for video playback",
    "In-app search should use a real embedded web browser or WebView rather than keyword-mapped placeholder results",
    "Search (photo and video) must be backed by a real browser-based search, not keyword maps or a standalone iframe browser tab",
    "Stories feature must only display real registered users — no fake/placeholder profile names or avatars"
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Account registration is broken and needs to be fixed alongside the auth migration to Apple/Google login",
    "Photos and videos are not displaying in the app (profile feed, chat, or search results)",
    "AI video generator does not show generated videos inline — users cannot tap to watch without saving",
    "Videos in search results or generator appear to be censored/restricted — user wants uncensored video content displayed",
    "Videos and images show a question mark placeholder and are not rendering — layout needs to be fixed",
    "Search page returns random/unrelated photos and videos instead of query-relevant results — search logic is not connected to user input",
    "AI image generator still failing after multiple retry attempts — Pollinations AI image endpoint may be unreachable or returning errors",
    "AI video generator still failing to load video — Pollinations AI video endpoint and Pexels fallback both appear broken",
    "Stories layout was removed or broken in a recent build — must be restored; fake placeholder user names must be removed from stories",
    "Design purchase flow lacks customization — users can buy a design but cannot customize it before purchasing"
