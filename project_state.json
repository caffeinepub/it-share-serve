Messaging is between in-app accounts only. AI generation follows standard content policies. Authentication uses Apple or Google login instead of Internet Identity.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Messaging is in-app only; no external SMS or phone network integration",
    "AI generation features must follow standard content policies — no unregulated generation",
    "Authentication uses Apple or Google OAuth — Internet Identity is not used",
    "Web photo/video search results are private — not displayed on user profile, feed, or any shared area",
    "Do not use YouTube as a video source — use alternative platforms (e.g., Pexels, Mixkit, Coverr) for video playback"

    "AI video generator does not show generated videos inline — users cannot tap to watch without saving",
    "Videos in search results or generator appear to be censored/restricted — user wants uncensored video content displayed",
    "Videos and images show a question mark placeholder and are not rendering — layout needs to be fixed"

For photo search, use multiple image source platforms (e.g., Unsplash source URLs and Picsum as fallback) so results always load. For video search, replace any YouTube-based embed or search results with direct MP4 sources from two alternative platforms (e.g., Pexels Videos API free tier and Mixkit). Ensure all search result thumbnails and videos render without broken icons or question mark placeholders.",
