# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Restore the original dark neon theme layout consistently across all screens and components.

**Planned changes:**
- Re-apply deep near-black backgrounds across all pages (Login, Register, Home, Chat, Contacts, Profile, Create, Search, Settings, CustomizeDesign, PurchaseConfirmation)
- Ensure neon accent colors (electric violet, cyan, hot pink) are consistently applied to buttons, borders, headings, and interactive elements
- Restore glowing UI elements, gradient highlights on cards, nav items, and action buttons
- Re-apply animated text effects (shimmer, glow, typewriter) where previously used
- Fix desktop sidebar and mobile bottom navigation to use dark neon styling
- Ensure CSS custom properties in index.css and Tailwind neon color tokens in tailwind.config.js are consistently applied across all components

**User-visible outcome:** Every page and component displays the dark neon aesthetic with no light or white backgrounds, restoring the original futuristic look throughout the entire application.
